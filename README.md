**Important note**

This is the code I've written in early 2015, after conceiving some ideas for a new unofficial expansion pack. But the most important thing realized, is this new ZT1 graphic editor.

It's still called Zoot.NET in the source which was the working title. It bears no affiliation with MadScientist's ZOOT tool, although big kudos to him for documenting a lot of the aspects of the file format.

**Using this code?**

Please credit MadScientist and myself.
Pull Requests are welcome, although I'm not actively working on this tool anymore.
When forking or using code or ideas explained in the documentation: please publish the complete code of your project too.
